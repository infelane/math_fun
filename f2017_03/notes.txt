The crack itself it typically darker than the background (low value)

first background substraction (tophat)

because crack is dark, do a negative RELU (only keep negative values)

! Combine Convolution with substraction into 1 single TF (middle value 1- original middle value)

1) Throw away all values higher than average (RELU) (removes the light marks)
